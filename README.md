BSc Thesis – Microcontroller-Based Liquid Level Control System

This repository contains the complete source code and documentation for my graduate thesis project: Microcontroller Measurements in Liquid Level Control Systems. The system features a PID controller implemented on an Arduino UNO, integrating ultrasonic and conductometric sensors, an Adafruit Motor Shield V1, and a ZC‑A40 pump to achieve automatic regulation of liquid level in a custom-built PMMA tank.
